# RFC: [Title]

## Summary
Brief explanation of the feature or change.

## Motivation
Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed design
This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement.

## Drawbacks
Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives
- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art
Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.

## Unresolved questions
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
