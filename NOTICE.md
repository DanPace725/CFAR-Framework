- **Quality Control**: Maintains authority over how the theory is presented and taught

### Code Liberation (Apache 2.0)
- **Broad Adoption**: Enables use in academic, commercial, and open-source projects
- **Patent Protection**: Explicit patent grant protects users and contributors
- **Industry Compatible**: Works with most corporate legal frameworks
- **Innovation Friendly**: Encourages experimentation and derivative implementations
